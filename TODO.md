# Panache TODO

This document tracks implementation status for Panache's features.

## Architecture and refactoring

- [x] Split `crates/panache-formatter/src/formatter/core.rs`'s
  `Formatter::format_node_sync` dispatch into cohesive formatter modules
  (document/blocks, containers, lists, tables, math, and raw content). Keep
  shared `Formatter` state in the core module and preserve idempotency
  golden coverage throughout.

- [x] Split `crates/panache-parser/src/parser/core.rs` at its line-framing and
  inner-content orchestration boundary. Extract cohesive list-item,
  blockquote, definition-list, and HTML-interruption protocols, but retain
  the parser's single-pass block-then-inline architecture in the
  orchestrator.

- [ ] Split `crates/panache-parser/src/parser/block_dispatcher.rs` by parser
  family: metadata/headings, references/lists, tables, code/TeX, HTML, and
  fenced containers. Keep `BlockParser`, its shared context types, and the
  registry's ordering in one authoritative place.

- [ ] Split `src/salsa.rs` by query domain: parsing, YAML, symbols, definitions,
  project graph, and database runtime. Re-export the present public API so
  callers do not need a broad migration.

- [ ] Split `src/main.rs`'s `run` match into command handlers for parse, format,
  lint, debug, clean, and LSP. Keep process startup, configuration loading
  helpers, and final top-level dispatch in `main.rs`.

- [ ] Split `crates/panache-parser/src/parser/blocks/html_blocks.rs` into HTML
  classification, Pandoc lifting, and CST emission. Treat Pandoc-native and
  CommonMark conformance as required regression gates because this code owns
  subtle parser structure.

- [ ] Split `crates/panache-parser/src/parser/yaml/validator.rs` by independent
  validation-rule family while retaining its single diagnostic-selection
  contract and YAML corpus coverage.

- [ ] Consider splitting `crates/panache-parser/src/parser/inlines/inline_ir.rs`
  into scanning, emphasis planning, bracket planning, and scratch allocation
  after higher-churn parser and formatter refactors land.

## Language Server

### Memory

- [x] Stop interning labels in the definition-index build. Salsa 0.28 reclaims
  the low-durability labels produced by edits, so the old interner was
  bounded rather than an unbounded leak. It still retained needless
  database-wide state and copied every key again when producing the owned
  index. Build the index on normalized owned strings directly;
  `InternedPath` remains bounded by distinct files.

### Code Actions

- [ ] Convert between table styles (simple, pipe, grid)
- [x] Convert between inline/reference links

### Navigation & Symbols

- [x] Find references - Find all uses of a reference link/footnote/citation
  - [x] Find references for citations - Find all `@cite` uses of a bibliography
    entry
  - [x] Find references for headings - Find all internal links to a heading
  - [x] Find references for reference links - Find all `[text][ref]` links

### Completion

- [ ] Reference link completion - Complete `[text][ref]` from defined references
- [ ] Heading link completion
- [ ] Attribute completion - Complete class names and attributes in
  `{.class #id}`
- [x] Shortcode completion - Complete Quarto shortcode names in `{{< name >}}`
- [x] Cross-reference completion - Complete `@fig-id` and `\@ref(fig-id)`
  cross-refs (also: file/shortcode path completion is implemented)

### Inlay Hints (low priority)

Personally I think inlay hints are distracting and I am not sure what we want to
support.

- [ ] Link target hints - Show link targets as inlay hints
- [ ] Reference definition hints - Show reference definitions as inlay hints
- [ ] Citation key hints - Show bibliography entries for `@cite` keys
- [ ] Footnote content hints - Show footnote content as inlay hints

### Advanced

- [x] Semantic tokens - Syntax highlighting via LSP (`semanticTokens/full`,
  additive + flavor-gated, custom legend;
  `src/lsp/handlers/semantic_tokens.rs`). Follow-ups: multi-line tokens
  (math/div bodies, per-line split); `full/delta`
  - `result_id`; `range` requests; widen the legend (emphasis/strong/links/
    headings --- only if we decide to contest the base grammar, which flips it
    to opt-in); raw-inline format tags (parser folds `{=fmt}` into a generic
    `ATTRIBUTE`, so a dedicated token kind is needed first).
- [ ] Rename
  - [x] Citations - Rename `@cite` keys and update bibliography
  - [x] Reference links - Rename `[ref]` labels and update definitions
  - [x] Headings - Rename heading text and update internal links
  - [x] Footnotes - Rename footnote labels and update definitions/links
  - [x] Files - Rename linked markdown files and update links
  - [x] Files - Rename other linked files, shortcodes, etc. Covers `embed`,
    `video`, and `placeholder` shortcode paths plus in-document frontmatter
    file paths (`bibliography`, `csl`, `css`). Deferred: raw HTML
    `src`/`href` and raw LaTeX `\input`/`\includegraphics` references;
    nested frontmatter paths such as `format.html.css`.
- [x] Configuration via LSP - `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` to reload
  config

### Spec coverage gaps

Markdown-relevant LSP methods we don't yet implement, surfaced by the 2026-06-18
spec-coverage audit (see `docs/guide/lsp.qmd` "LSP Specification Coverage").
`onTypeFormatting`, `semanticTokens`, `inlayHint`, and
`workspace/didChangeConfiguration` are tracked above and not repeated here.

- [x] Pull diagnostics - `textDocument/diagnostic` + `workspace/diagnostic` as a
  companion/alternative to the current push model (mode-switch: pull clients
  get pull only, push suppressed; cache + `workspace/diagnostic/refresh`)
  - [x] Populate `related_documents` in the document report for clients with
    `related_document_support` (the pulled document's project-graph closure
    carries its related files' cross-file diagnostics inline)
  - [x] Streaming/partial results (`DocumentDiagnosticReportPartialResult`,
    `WorkspaceDiagnosticReportPartialResult`): a `partialResultToken`
    streams the report's tail as `$/progress` chunks (response carries the
    first chunk). No token still returns the whole report
  - [ ] `workspace/diagnostic` only reports open documents + reachable project
    manifests, not every on-disk doc in the workspace (rust-analyzer pulls
    all workspace files). Decide whether closed-but-on-disk docs should
    surface.
- [x] `textDocument/documentHighlight` - highlight every occurrence of the
  reference/citation/footnote/heading under the cursor
- [ ] `textDocument/selectionRange` - structural smart-select expansion (word →
  inline → block → section)
- [x] `textDocument/linkedEditingRange` - edit a reference label and its
  definition simultaneously
- [x] `completionItem/resolve` - defer expensive completion detail (e.g.
  citation previews) until an item is focused
- [ ] `codeAction/resolve` + advertise `codeActionKinds` - compute edits lazily
  and let clients filter actions by kind
- [x] `workspace/didChangeWorkspaceFolders` - multi-root workspaces; config
  resolves per-document against the containing folder, and add/remove
  re-resolves open documents live
- [x] `workspace/configuration` - pull runtime settings from the client (after
  `initialized` and on `didChangeConfiguration`) instead of relying only on
  discovered config files and pushed settings
- [ ] `workspace/executeCommand` - server-side commands backing complex code
  actions
- [x] File operations beyond `willRenameFiles`: `didRenameFiles`,
  `didCreateFiles`, `didDeleteFiles` (hygiene-only;
  `willCreate`/`willDelete` intentionally omitted)

#### Out of scope for prose

These spec methods target compiled-language tooling and have no useful Markdown
analogue; do not re-audit them: call hierarchy, type hierarchy,
`textDocument/implementation`, `typeDefinition`, `declaration`, `inlineValue`,
`moniker`, document color, and code lens.

### Future Lint Rules

#### Syntax correctness

- [ ] Broken table structures
- [ ] Invalid citation syntax (`@citekey` malformations)
- [ ] Unclosed inline math/code spans
- [ ] Invalid shortcode syntax (Quarto-specific)

#### Style/Best practices

- [ ] Multiple top-level headings
- [ ] Empty links/images
- [ ] Unused reference definitions
- [ ] Hard-wrapped text in code blocks
- [ ] Use blanklines around horizontal rules
- [ ] Rebindable R boolean aliases in chunk options—warn on unquoted `T` and `F`
  where a boolean-valued inline R chunk option is expected; do not autofix
  because either symbol may be rebound

### Linter bugs and performance (quarto-web triage, 2026-08)

#### False positives: `undefined-anchor` on render-generated anchors

- [ ] `undefined-anchor` flags anchors that only exist after render: Quarto
  listing categories (`gallery/index.qmd` → `#articles-reports`, etc.) and
  include-partials that link to a heading in their *parent*
  (`_incremental-pause.md` → `#creating-slides`, linted standalone). Static
  analysis can't see these targets; consider a heuristic or an opt-out for
  known render-time / cross-document anchors.

### Configuration

- [ ] Severity levels (error, warning, info)
- [ ] Auto-fix capability per rule (infrastructure exists, rules need
  implementation)

## Math parser and formatter redesign

Markdown and LaTeX math bodies use the same TeX-math grammar. Within a math
body, Panache's CST should therefore be structurally isomorphic to Badness's:
the same token boundaries, node hierarchy, attachment rules, recovery behavior,
and semantic views, with only a mechanical `MATH_*` kind prefix where Panache's
global kind namespace or host-byte filtering requires it. Badness's `MATH` node
corresponds to Panache's native, lossless `MATH_CONTENT` subtree.

Panache still owns its complete production implementation. There must be no
runtime Badness dependency, shared crate, formatter delegation, foreign CST in
Salsa, or projection step in the parser, formatter, linter, or language server.
Pinned Badness crates are permitted as development-only differential oracles;
their trees and formatted output exist only inside tests.

Panache's host parser remains responsible for Pandoc/CommonMark delimiter rules,
deciding which raw environments contain math, container-prefix handling,
Bookdown equation labels, Pandoc attributes, source-range mapping, and
delimiter-style policy. Keep these host constructs outside the TeX-math subtree
where possible. Unavoidable interleaved host trivia, such as blockquote and list
prefixes, is the only structural exception and must be ignored mechanically by
the test projector.

### Completed foundation

- [x] Pin `badness-parser` and `badness-formatter` as development-only oracles;
  add mechanical CST projectors, a parser differential report, and
  controlled formatter wrappers. The shared parser corpus currently passes
  82/82 cases.
- [x] Match Badness's lexical and structural CST for the shared corpus,
  including commands and arguments, scripts, environments, `\left`/`\right`,
  and malformed-input recovery.
- [x] Add Panache-owned built-in signatures, argument domains, raw-TeX
  redefinition overlays, atom metadata, Unicode-scalar iteration, structural
  atoms, and scripted-base inheritance.
- [x] Keep `MATH_SPACE` and `MATH_NEWLINE` distinct from host trivia, strip
  injected container prefixes in `math_content_text()`, and retain direct
  host-document ranges.
- [x] Surface `math-syntax` diagnostics through native CST walks shared by the
  formatter, linter, and language server.

## Parser

### Downstream document consumers (Polydoc)

Polydoc will use `panache-parser` as an in-process reader for supported GFM and
QMD profiles, translate the result into its own document IR, optionally execute
code cells, and render HTML itself. Panache should expose syntax and provenance
conveniently without taking ownership of execution, document-model, or rendering
policy.

- [x] Add consumer-facing, typed `BlockNode` and `InlineNode` enums and
  iterators over semantic children. Cover the supported Markdown containers
  and leaves, distinguish trivia explicitly, and retain an
  unknown/unsupported case carrying the original syntax kind, node, and
  range so consumers cannot drop new syntax silently.
- [x] Add typed child traversal for paragraphs, headings, block quotes, list
  items, table cells, alerts/callouts, and fenced divs. A consumer should be
  able to build a normalized document tree without matching raw `SyntaxKind`
  values or depending on CST child layout.
- [x] Complete the common semantic accessors needed by a document adapter:
  decoded text, attributes, link and image targets, heading levels, table
  alignment, and host-aligned ranges for both complete constructs and their
  meaningful payloads. Keep these views lossless and policy-free.
- [x] Add a consolidated executable-code-cell view over `CodeBlock`: language,
  full cell and code ranges, executable source with hashpipe option lines
  excluded, labels/classes/identifier, and every inline or hashpipe option
  with its value, provenance, and source range. Preserve duplicate and
  overridden declarations so a downstream validator can diagnose them;
  provide a separate resolved view only when precedence is unambiguous.
- [x] Provide a direct typed path from document frontmatter and hashpipe hosts
  to their parsed YAML documents, cooked scalar values, and host ranges
  while retaining the existing embedded-language syntax errors. Consumers
  should not need to locate internal YAML wrapper nodes or parse YAML a
  second time.
- [x] Add a small downstream-consumer test corpus covering GFM prose, QMD cells,
  hashpipe options, nested containers, tables, callouts, raw constructs, and
  malformed embedded YAML. Assert typed traversal, source ranges, and
  visible unsupported nodes rather than serialized Pandoc output.
- [x] Document this API as a CST-to-consumer adapter surface. Do not make
  `to_pandoc_ast` or `to_pandoc_json` its contract: those projectors remain
  Pandoc-conformance tools, and downstream applications retain their own IR
  and rendering policy.

### Issues

Note any known parser issues here.

- [ ] Stop letting `pandoc_ast.rs` drift into a second-stage parser. Load-
  bearing byte-walkers (`split_html_block_by_tags`, `parse_pandoc_blocks`
  and the refs/heading-id reparse helpers) re-tokenize source the CST should
  already encode. This violates the single-pass invariant in `AGENTS.md` and
  hides structural decisions from downstream consumers (linter, salsa, LSP,
  formatter) which all walk the CST, not the projector. The guiding
  principle: when the parser computes a structural fact during its single
  pass, it must emit that fact into the CST (wrapping existing source bytes,
  `HTML_ATTRS`-style --- never synthetic tokens) instead of forcing the
  projector to recompute it. Each bucket below is its own bounded step,
  verified against pandoc-native + CommonMark (both must stay byte-identical
  or improve).

- [ ] `prepare_yaml_content` is still worth a second look now that the indent
  gate landed: the dispatcher reaches `detect_prepared` for the same line
  2-3 times per parse (via `continuation.rs`'s re-detection), so the gate is
  recomputed for content it has already seen. A per-parse memo would
  collapse that, but it needs parse-scoped storage (a thread-local cache
  would retain green trees across parses and would also flatter the
  benchmark, which reuses one process).

### Incremental Parsing

The LSP splices its tree off the previous parse through a four-tier ladder ---
token, region, section window, suffix window --- in
`crates/panache-parser/src/parser/reparse.rs`. The architecture and the reason
behind every guard live with the code: that module's doc carries the ladder and
the guard catalogue, `docs/development/lsp.qmd` the host side, and
`benches/lsp_incremental.rs` the measurements. The multi-session roadmap that
built it is finished; what follows is only what it left open.

**Governing invariant:** a successful reparse yields a green tree and
syntax-error vector byte-identical to a full parse of the edited text, enforced
by a `cfg(debug_assertions)` oracle on every reparse. Every guard failure bails
to a full parse --- never an error, never a best effort. A divergence is fixed
by adding a bail, never by relaxing an oracle assert.

**Gates before touching any of this:** `task bench:lsp-gate` (both bench gates,
release, default iteration count --- a shortened run measures sampling noise),
`PANACHE_FUZZ_ITERS=20 cargo test -p panache-parser --test incremental_fuzz`,
and the workspace suite with `PANACHE_INCREMENTAL_PARSING` forced both ways.
Speedup floors are calibrated \~5% under the lowest of three runs on an idle
machine; a floor set against a loaded one produces a gate that fails later for
no reason.

#### Cost ceilings

- [x] **Defer `refdef_set`'s whole-document scan until reparse fallback.** A
  successful reparse proves its edit cannot change a reference definition,
  so it retains the previous set; only a declined attempt scans before the
  full parse.

- [x] **`diff_edit` re-derives an edit the LSP already knows.** Carry the
  coalesced edit through the reparse side channel instead of walking both
  whole texts before every attempt.

- [x] **Share `BlockParserRegistry` across parses.** `Parser` now borrows one
  lazily initialized process-wide registry instead of allocating and
  populating a vector of 27 boxed parser trait objects on every parse. The
  expected small-region exemption still does not pay: with a 4 KiB
  always-try floor, `multi_change_utf16_4` measured 8.27 us against a 3.85
  us full parse, and `multi_change_small_4` measured 97.38 us against 44.28
  us. The fractional guard therefore remains in force for small documents
  too.

- [ ] **The write-phase medium row is only break-even.** `large_authoring.qmd`
  measures 1.05x end to end (`benches/lsp_write_phase.rs`) where
  `benches/lsp_incremental.rs` splices the same document at 4.0x. The two
  edit different positions --- 4/5 of the way through against line 60 --- so
  the gap is either a shape the region tier declines at that position or
  host-side work only the end-to-end bench includes. Worth finding out
  which, because the end-to-end number is the one a user feels.

#### Tier coverage

- [ ] **Widen the token tier.** It answers only an edit strictly inside a plain
  `TEXT` token of a top-level `PARAGRAPH`. Deferred and still open: edits
  that touch a token boundary (needs join probes), non-`TEXT` leaf kinds,
  and `PLAIN` / heading-content / code-body parents. Each is a decline today
  that a keystroke could have.

- [ ] **Nested-container regions.** Regions are restricted to top-level
  `DOCUMENT` children, because a fragment lifted out of a list item or a div
  needs a fragment entry point carrying container stack, open fences, and
  refdef scope --- fatou records the same lesson. `ParseOrigin` is the
  degenerate top-level case of exactly that entry point, so the shape to
  generalize already exists.

- [ ] **The long-range pairing guard is coarse.** `long_range_pairing_lines`
  declines whenever the region's fence, div, math, comment, or bare `-`/`=`
  rule lines differ before and after the edit --- sound, but it refuses
  every edit that so much as retypes a fence. A precise version would ask
  the *old tree* whether a candidate line actually parsed as a delimiter,
  which is the check `prefix_fence_state_is_stable`'s parity heuristic also
  wants.

- [ ] **The retained-`DEFINITION_LIST` guard is coarse** in the same way.
  Definition items merge into one list node across blank lines, and the
  marker that opens the merging item need not lead the window, so the guard
  pairs a retained `DEFINITION_LIST` with a `:`/`~` marker line *anywhere*
  in the window (`has_definition_marker_line`) and declines. A precise
  version would bound the reach at the first window block that cannot belong
  to a definition list --- a heading or a fence breaks the chain --- but
  deciding that textually is re-implementing the block parser, so it wants
  the same ask-the-old-tree treatment as the item above. Pinned by
  `definition_marker_suffix_after_a_retained_definition_list` and
  `definition_list_grown_below_a_retained_definition_list`.

### Coverage

- [x] Extension: `task_lists` - GitHub-style `- [ ]` and `- [x]`
- [x] Extension: `definition_lists` - Term/definition syntax

### Code Blocks

- [x] Fenced code blocks (backticks and tildes)

### Fenced Divs

- [x] Basic fenced divs (`::: {.class}`)
- [x] Nested fenced divs
- [x] Colon count normalization based on nesting
- [x] Proper formatting with attribute preservation
- [x] Top-level indented lone `:::` diverges from pandoc. Panache accepted up to
  3 leading spaces on a closing fence, so `::: outer\ntext\n  :::` closed
  the div; pandoc instead treats the indented `:::` as paragraph text and
  leaves the div implicitly closed at EOF (`Str ":::"`). Fixed by tracking
  the opener's indent on `Container::FencedDiv` and rejecting a closer more
  indented than its opener in `FencedDivCloseParser` (scoped to the no-list
  frame so the #439 in-list handling is untouched). Surfaced 2026-07-28
  while fixing #439.
- [ ] Nested fenced divs inside a list item are mis-parsed: the outer div is
  left unclosed and its trailing `:::` becomes stray text, which surfaces as
  a `stray-fenced-div-markers` lint false positive (e.g.
  `docs/authoring/markdown-basics.qmd`). Minimal repro: a `- -` nested list
  whose inner item opens a `pad` div, contains a fully closed `light` div,
  then a trailing `:::` to close `pad`. Pandoc closes both divs
  (`Div .pad [ Div .light ]`); panache leaves `pad` open and strays the
  closer. Surfaced 2026-08 in the quarto-web triage.

  formatting deferred)
- [x] Extension: `table_captions` - Table captions (both before and after

- [x] Extension: `footnotes` - Reference-style footnotes

#### Citations

- [x] Extension: `citations` - `[@cite]` and `@cite` syntax with complex key
  support

- [x] Pandoc `notAfterString` for bare `@key`: a citation glued to a preceding
  word character is literal text, not a citation (`word@key`,
  `user@example.com`, `違法編訂@jzkhl`). Handled at the shared detection
  site via a char-before-`@` check (alphanumeric or `.` suppresses); the
  `-@` suppress-author form is exempt. Backs the `unspaced-citation` lint
  rule. Closes #448.

- [x] `notAfterString` delimiter-adjacent corner: a bare `@key` glued to a
  *resolved closing emphasis/strong delimiter* is now suppressed to match
  pandoc (`*em*@key` and `**strong**@key` are `Emph`/`Strong` +
  `Str "@key"`). The IR consults the emphasis pass's result when building
  the construct plan (`demote_bare_citation_after_emphasis_closer`), keying
  off resolved closers only, so `*@key*` (opener) and `*em*-@key`
  (suppress-author) keep the citation. No extra scan: the correction reads
  already-computed delimiter state rather than re-classifying.

- [ ] `unspaced-citation` covers citations only. A crossref glued to a word
  (`x@fig-plot`) is likewise left as text by the parser but not flagged by
  the rule; extend it to crossref keys (gated on `quarto_crossrefs`) as a
  follow-up.

#### Spans

- [x] Extension: `markdown_in_html_blocks` - Markdown inside HTML blocks

#### Raw LaTeX

- [x] Extension: `raw_tex` - Inline LaTeX commands (`\cite{ref}`,
  `\textbf{text}`, etc.)
- [x] Extension: `raw_tex` - Block LaTeX environments
  (`\begin{tabular}...\end{tabular}`)
- [x] Extension: `latex_macros` - Expand LaTeX macros (conversion feature, not
  formatting concern)

#### Other Raw

- [x] Extension: `raw_attribute` - Generic raw blocks `{=format}`

### Escapes & Special Characters

#### Backslash Escapes

- [x] Extension: `all_symbols_escapable` - Backslash escapes any symbol
- [x] Extension: `angle_brackets_escapable` - Escape `<` and `>`
- [x] Escape sequences in inline elements (emphasis, code, math)

These extensions are **not enabled by default** in Pandoc and are lower priority
for initial implementation.

## Additional Markdown flavors

### mdsvex / Svelte-flavored Markdown

MVP support for [mdsvex](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io) (`.svx`, `.svelte.md`). mdsvex
(≤0.12.x) builds on `remark-parse@8`, whose options default to `gfm: true`, so
tables, strikethrough, bare autolinks, and task lists work with **no plugins**
(confirmed by the getting-started example and real plugin-free
`svelte.config.js` setups; `remark-gfm` is only for modern remark). So
`Flavor::Mdsvex` is a CommonMark-*dialect* flavor with the GFM extension set +
`raw_html` + `yaml_metadata_block` + `svelte-template`, minus the extras mdsvex
does not enable by default (footnotes, math, emoji, alerts). The `{...}`
attribute "collision" with Pandoc syntax evaporates because the CommonMark
dialect leaves every attribute extension (`header_attributes`,
`bracketed_spans`, `fenced_divs`, `raw_attribute`) off, so `{` is free for
Svelte. `svelte-template` is off for every other flavor (zero behavior change
elsewhere).

- [x] MVP: `Flavor::Mdsvex` + `svelte-template` extension; `.svx`/`.svelte.md`
  detection; CLI/WASM/schema surfaces.

- [x] Opaque, sigil-distinguished inline spans (`SVELTE_BLOCK_LOGIC` for
  `{#…}`/`{:…}`/`{/…}`, `SVELTE_TAG` for `{@…}`, `SVELTE_EXPRESSION` for
  `{expr}`), content preserved verbatim. Balanced-brace scan reused from the
  shortcode parser. Parser golden + formatter golden + unit tests landed.

- [x] **Tier 2: block-level `{#if}`/`{#each}` pairing.** Standalone Svelte spans
  (block logic `{#if}`/`{:else}`/`{/each}`, tags `{@html}`, and expressions
  `{expr}`) that occupy a whole line are now emitted as an opaque
  `SVELTE_BLOCK` leaf block (mirroring the MyST leaf-block pattern) that
  acts as a block boundary. This fixes the prior quirk where a lone-span
  paragraph adjacent to a *tight* list (no blank line) got joined onto one
  line and its inner whitespace collapsed. The equivalent quirk for Quarto
  shortcode lines (`{{< ... >}}`) is still a separate pre-existing issue and
  is not addressed here.

- [ ] **Tier 3: format the JS/Svelte inside spans** (prettier-plugin-svelte
  territory). Likely out of scope.

- [ ] String-literal-aware brace matching: a `}` inside a JS string (`{ "}" }`)
  can terminate a span early (depth-counting only). Lossless fallback
  (literal `{`), but a real Svelte tokenizer would fix it.

- [ ] AST wrappers (`syntax/svelte.rs`), LSP semantic tokens, and lint rules for
  Svelte constructs.

### MyST

MyST (`mystmd.org`, `myst-parser`) support, modeled the same way as mdsvex: a
CommonMark-*dialect* flavor whose `myst_defaults` enables MyST-specific
extensions (`myst-directives`, `myst-roles`, `myst-targets`, `myst-comments`,
`myst-block-breaks`) plus the GFM-superset rules `myst-parser` turns on
(`pipe-tables`, `footnotes`, `yaml-metadata-block`). Behavior is gated on those
extension flags, never on `Flavor::Myst` directly, so other flavors can borrow
the same shapes. Markup extras (`myst-colon-fence`, `myst-substitutions`,
dollar-math, deflists, ...) stay opt-in.

- [ ] **LSP semantic tokens for MyST.** Wrapper-driven classification of
  directive/role names, target labels, and substitution names. Depends on
  the AST wrappers.

- [ ] **Lint rules for MyST constructs.** Gate on the `myst-*` extension flags
  (never `Flavor::Myst` directly), via the `add-lint-rule` skill. Start with
  `undefined-references` (role target resolves to a `MystTarget`) and an
  unknown-directive/role check. Depends on the AST wrappers.
